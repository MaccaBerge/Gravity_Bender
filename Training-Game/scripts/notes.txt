
hitboxes:

    - When using one hitbox that goes out of the normal rect of a physics entity, the speed has to be high enough to use it, otherwise it
      will teleport you to the other side of the wall. Therfore, if you want a horizontal hitbox that is larger than the rect, you must
      create two seperate hitboxes for each direction.

Player bouncing because of size (collision "seams" to not work):

    - When using the get_tiles_around function in the tilemap, it only gets the tiles around the position, if the player gets really big,
      what can happen is that those tiles arnt egnough. So either the player has to become smaller or the tiles bigger.
    

After transition from ground to ceiling, player pop though the ceiling (probably vise versa):

    - For the same reason you fo though the floor when you dont set the velocity[1] to 0, you need to set the velocity[1] to 0 each update
      when the player is transitioning from floor to ceiling (and vise versa).
